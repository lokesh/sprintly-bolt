**This project is not actively being worked on.**

This was a small side-project I started while at [Getaround](https://www.getaround.com) where we used [Sprintly](https://sprint.ly) to manage our sprints. The tech stack includes the following:

- Organized with [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/)
- Built with [Backbone.Marionette](http://marionettejs.com/)
- Search powered by [lunr.js](http://lunrjs.com/)
